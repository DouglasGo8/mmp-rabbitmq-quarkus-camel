= RabbitMQ & Quarkus Camel for System Integration

* Setup RabbitMQ over Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -d --name rabbitmq --restart always \
  --hostname docker-rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 \
  -v /media/data/.rabbitmq:/var/lib/rabbitmq/mnesia rabbitmq:management

== Basic Concepts

. Queue is a buffer that stores a message, before any consumer take it
. Exchange routing a message to correct queue
. Routing key is a key that the exchange looks at to decide how to route the messate for a queue(s)
. Biding is a link thas connects exchange to queue(s)
. Distributed message to queue(s)
. Copy message if required
. Based on message routing key
. Several type of exchanges
. Binding: correlation between exchange - queues

=== Kinds of Exchange

==== Fanout
.. Multiple queues of single message
.. Broadcast to all queues bound to it
.. Copy and send messages to all queues
.. Fanout Sample Configuration
.. Fanout can be compared with AWS SQS

[source,json]
----
{
  "exchange_name":  "exg.fanout.hr",
  "queues": [
    {
      "queue_name": "rmq.accounting.hr"
    },
    {
      "queue_name": "rmq.marketing.hr"
    }
  ]
}
----

==== Direct
.. Send Selective queues(s)
.. Based on Routing key
.. Message can be discarded

[source,json]
----
{
  "exchange_name":  "exg.direct.proc",
  "routing_key": "must specify in camel using .toD one of following values [apple, android]",
  "queues": [
    {
      "queue_name": "rmq.accounting.proc"
    },
    {
      "queue_name": "rmq.marketing.proc"
    }
  ]
}
